<h2>A Starbucks Official Website Framework (Clone Made using only HTML and CSS).</h2>
Hey There Viewers,<br>
  So This Is My First Project and I'm Actually Using <em>Github</em> For The First Time,So It's A Quite A Tricky Task For Me To Know What I'm Doing,<br>
  But Let's Not Stray Away From The Topic,So This Is My First Project To Be Uploaded On Github And Made For an Audience To see and Review.<br>
  This Webpage IS made using Only <strong>HTML,CSS & Bootstrap</strong> , as I'm Currently Pursuiving career in Full Stack Web Dev. and Being In FY of my Graduation,
  I'm Currently Well Versed In HTML and CSS so To Test My Skills Before Starting <strong>Javascript</strong>, and made this Website WHich IS ACtually a Clone of
  <em>Starbuck's Website</em> (Credit To It's Makers Its Actually Good and P.S Thanks For Inspiring ME to Recreate It). SO Basically Its a FrameWork Of The Website<br><br>
  
 <b><u> Note: </u></b> All The Links In THe FrameWork Are set to <em>href='#'</em> , so there's No Final Destination after pressing on a link/button
